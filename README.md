# Block-Fall

A dodge the block game in Unity. 

Players play as a turqoise sphere and they can control it horizontally.
The players try and avoid the red cubes that are quickly falling from the sky!

If the player gets hit, then they will be unable to move and the UI will update to say Game Over! 
The scene will reload after the game ends in one second. 

Occasionally, the player might see a yellow cube falling from the sky. Hitting this 
color cube will not do any damage!
